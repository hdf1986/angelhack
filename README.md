We participated on and won the hackaton organized by http://angelhack.com/.

The proposal was to make a website that acted like a data hub that centralizes -biometric, academic, or any measurable- data related to the user.

The system will perform data mining and find relationships between all this metrics, like for example, the relationship between how have you been eating and sleeping and your grades at college.

We did a *very basic* implementation of the site in < 15 hours, using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient.menos
